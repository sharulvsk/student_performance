📅 Final Workflow
🔍 Objective
Train a machine learning model on a student performance dataset.
Optimize a deep learning model to capture patterns accurately.
Visualize training performance with percentage loss and accuracy.
Save relevant plots and models.
🔹 Components Breakdown
Data Preparation
Collected data and prepared a student_performance CSV file.
Split dataset into training and testing splits.
ML Training
Trained a scikit-learn model using Regression algorithms to predict performance metrics.
DL Training
